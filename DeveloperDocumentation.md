# DEVELOPER GUIDELINES

# How to contribute

## Obtaining source code
If your system uses multiple repositories or submodules, provide clear instructions for how to obtain all relevant sources.
## Directory Layout
What do the various directories (folders) contain, and where to find source files, tests, documentation, data files, etc.
How to build the software. Provide clear instructions for how to use your project’s build system to build all system components.

## Build process
Describe any tasks that are not automated. For example, should a developer update a version number (in code and documentation) prior to invoking the build system? Are there any sanity checks a developer should perform after building a release?
## How to test the software
Provide clear instructions for how to run the system’s test cases. In some cases, the instructions may need to include information such as how to access data sources or how to interact with external systems. You may reference the user documentation (e.g., prerequisites) to avoid duplication.
## Adding new tests
Are there any naming conventions/patterns to follow when naming test files? Is there a particular test harness to use?
## Build/Release
Describe any tasks that are not automated. For example, should a developer update a version number (in code and documentation) prior to invoking the build system? Are there any sanity checks a developer should perform after building a release?

## Coding conventions
In order to sanitize coding standards, please follow [this Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), [this SQL style guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/platform/sql-style-guide/), and [this JavaScript style guide](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/javascript/).
