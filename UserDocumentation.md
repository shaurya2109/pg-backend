# USER MANUAL

### Project Description
Pocket Grocer is a web application that empowers individuals, as well as those living in communal living spaces, to keep track of grocery items and respective expiration dates in order to minimize their food waste. The 3 main operational use cases with which this application aims to help users are:
1. Keeping track of their groceries in both the fridge and pantry
2. Creating household "groups" in which they can add other users, and see and share the items in that household
3. Filtering and sorting the items in their grocery inventory

### Installing software
If your system has prerequisites (e.g., tools, libraries, emulators, third-party applications, etc.), your 
instructions should list all of them and indicate how to install and configure them. Make sure to indicate what specific 
version requirements these prerequisites must satisfy. If running the system requires the installation of, e.g., a virtual 
machine, a database, or an emulator, make sure to provide
### How to build/run

### How to use the system
You can assume that your user is familiar with your particular platform (e.g., use of a Web browser, desktop applications, 
or mobile applications). For missing functionality, your documentation should simply indicate that this functionality is work in progress.
### Bug Reporting
We will use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shaurya2109/pg-backend/issues) to keep track of bugs. If you experience an issue, please navigate to this page and add "New issue" via the green "New issue" button.
1. Write a ~10 word description of the bug to be the title. A good summary should quickly and uniquely identify a bug report. It should explain the problem, not the suggested solution.
2. Write a detailed, ordered list of steps to reproduce the issue.
3. After your steps, precisely describe the observed (actual) result and the expected result. Clearly separate facts (observations) from speculations.
